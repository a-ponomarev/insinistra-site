title: About
---

Cast in lilac haze, somewhere between a lullaby and a nightmare, Insinistra crafts a symphonic metal experience that is both macabre and sweet.

The band weaves heavy riffs with lush orchestration, creating an intricate soundscape where fragility meets force. At its center stands a voice — tender, haunting, and suddenly fierce. The music balances delicacy with intensity, exploring bliss and horrors from both the real world and dark tales — touching on mysticism and the labyrinth of the human psyche.

Based in Prague, Insinistra is led by vocalist Maria Shell — the creative force behind the songwriting and orchestrations — and drummer Alexander Ponomarev, whose powerful metal arrangements shape the project’s dynamic backbone. The line-up is completed by guitarist Serge Melnikov and bassist Boris Gut, whose deep growls add a darker edge to the band’s gothic soundscape.
